Seamless Stitching:

- When you stitch image tiles back together, maintaining consistency at the edges 
(avoiding seams or visible artifacts) will be tricky. Overlapping tiles slightly and blending 
the overlaps can help mitigate this.

Research Edge Blending:

- Look into strategies like overlapping patches and blending regions to ensure seamless stitching.
